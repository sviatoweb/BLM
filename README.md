# Discrete Math Project: Game of Life with Genetic and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithms

## Introduction

This Python project combines the concepts of Conway's Game of Life, Genetic Algorithms, and Ant Colony Optimization. The simulation involves four distinct races that interact with each other. Each race has its own set of attributes, including health, libido, strength, and stamina, which are modeled using a finite state machine.

## Features

- **Game of Life Simulation:** The project utilizes the principles of Conway's Game of Life to simulate the life cycles and interactions of different races.

- **Genetic Algorithm:** Races reproduce and mutate over time, influencing their traits based on genetic algorithms. The genetic algorithm is used for evolving the attributes of each race.

- **Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm:** Races move and engage in battles using an Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, determining their paths and interactions based on the principles of ant colonies.

## Races and Attributes

- **Health:** Represents the overall health and well-being of each race member.

- **Libido:** Determines the reproductive capabilities of each race. Influences the rate of reproduction.

- **Strength:** Reflects the combat abilities of each race. Affects the outcome of battles.

- **Stamina:** Represents the endurance and resilience of each race. Influences the race's ability to survive and reproduce.

## Finite State Machine

Each race is modeled using a finite state machine with different states representing various aspects of their life cycle, such as reproduction, movement, and combat.
